CHAT PANEL

Ok so what's our goal? Our goal is to get a chat panel where we can highlight a section of text, then in the chat panel, we show the text at the top. And we can ask a question of the AI and have a conversation.

structure: 3 divs for highlight, chat, and text response

TO DOs:

1. Create two modes minis mode and chat mode.

2. On highlights, show button, triggers chat mode

3. create 3 divs. Chat should be scrollable overflow y whatever

4.

MINIS - so we have minis behind which are persistent.

And then the metaphor is that we have a chat window which covers the minis. I think one issue is that we get a scroll issue.

Rough organizational structure we have 3 divs
