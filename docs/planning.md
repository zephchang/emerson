Ok so what are my goals?

Let's see the old software how did it work?

Ok so we've got on the left some text side by side. I would like to have the ability to renderthe left side dynamically

> create one module and get hello world to show up via there. [done]

BOOK PANEL

> OK so we want our book panel to render the two books. It's going to be <p> tags inside of divs.
> Which means we need to get the paragarph in the form of a list.
> We need some kind of proccessing to take the pure text and turn it into a list of <p>s. We should have an original and a side by side and they better zip up otherwise we've got problems.

Ok I'm pissed off at the streamlit version - it's just no good. let's do this fucking backend.

> step 1: create json [done]

> get python to import json [done]

> get json to upload to supabase [done]

> Get rewrite done where we can pull from supabase [done]

> setup a backend using python [done]

> Let's get the paragraphs into the UI

> And then go back and do kant's full prologuea
